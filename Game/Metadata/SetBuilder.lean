/-- Set builder syntax. This can be elaborated to either a `Set` or a `Finset` depending on context.

The elaborators for this syntax are located in:
* `Data.Set.Defs` for the `Set` builder notation elaborator for syntax of the form `{x | p x}`,
  `{x : α | p x}`, `{binder x | p x}`.
* `Data.Finset.Basic` for the `Finset` builder notation elaborator for syntax of the form
  `{x ∈ s | p x}`.
* `Data.Fintype.Basic` for the `Finset` builder notation elaborator for syntax of the form
  `{x | p x}`, `{x : α | p x}`, `{x ∉ s | p x}`, `{x ≠ a | p x}`.
* `Order.LocallyFinite.Basic` for the `Finset` builder notation elaborator for syntax of the form
  `{x ≤ a | p x}`, `{x ≥ a | p x}`, `{x < a | p x}`, `{x > a | p x}`.

/-- Elaborate set builder notation for `Set`.

* `{x | p x}` is elaborated as `Set.setOf fun x ↦ p x`
* `{x : α | p x}` is elaborated as `Set.setOf fun x : α ↦ p x`
* `{binder x | p x}`, where `x` is bound by the `binder` binder, is elaborated as
  `{x | binder x ∧ p x}`. The typical example is `{x ∈ s | p x}`, which is elaborated as
  `{x | x ∈ s ∧ p x}`. The possible binders are
  * `· ∈ s`, `· ∉ s`
  * `· ⊆ s`, `· ⊂ s`, `· ⊇ s`, `· ⊃ s`
  * `· ≤ a`, `· ≥ a`, `· < a`, `· > a`, `· ≠ a`

  More binders can be declared using the `binder_predicate` command, see `Init.BinderPredicates` for
  more info.

* `{ pat : X | p }` is notation for pattern matching in set-builder notation,
  where `pat` is a pattern that is matched by all objects of type `X`
  and `p` is a proposition that can refer to variables in the pattern.
  It is the set of all objects of type `X` which, when matched with the pattern `pat`,
  make `p` come out true.
* `{ pat | p }` is the same, but in the case when the type `X` can be inferred.

For example, `{ (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m * n = 12 }` denotes the set of all ordered pairs of
natural numbers whose product is 12.

Note that if the type ascription is left out and `p` can be interpreted as an extended binder,
then the extended binder interpretation will be used.  For example, `{ n + 1 | n < 3 }` will
be interpreted as `{ x : Nat | ∃ n < 3, n + 1 = x }` rather than using pattern matching.
