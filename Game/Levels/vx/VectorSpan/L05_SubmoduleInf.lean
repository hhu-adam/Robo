-- Introduction
-- Given a (finite or infinite) family of vector subspaces of a vector space V,
-- we can define the greatest common subspace of this family as the intersection
-- of all the subspaces in the family. In this level you will prove that the set
-- intersection of a family of subspaces is a subspace.
