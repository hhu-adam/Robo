Title "" -- "Kernel"

Introduction
"
We show that every function `f : A → B` induces a congruence on `A`. We say elements `x`
and `y` of `A` are kernel-congruent if `f x = f y`.
This is the equivalence relation `ker f` on `A` denoted by `ker f`.
```
x ≈ y ↔ f x = f y
```

You might be familiar with the kernel of a group homomorphism which the set of elements
that are sent to the identity element of the codomain. The kernel of a group
homomorphism is a subgroup of the domain.

In this level you show that these two notions of kernel coincide: Two elements `x` and `y` of `A` are kernel congruent if and only if their difference is in the kernel of `f`.
