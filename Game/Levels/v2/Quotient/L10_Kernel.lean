Title "" -- "Kernel relation"

Introduction
"
We show that every function `f : A → B` induces a congruence on `A`.
We say elements `x` and `y` of `A` are kernel-congruent if `f x = f y`.
This is the equivalence relation `ker f` on `A` denoted by `ker f`.
```
x ≈ y ↔ f x = f y
```

In this level, you show that if `f : A → B` is injective then
`x` and `y` are kernel-congruent if and only if they are equal.
