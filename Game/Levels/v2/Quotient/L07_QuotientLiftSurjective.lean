Title "" -- "When Is Quotient Lift Surjective"

Introduction
"
In the previous level we explained that for a setoid on a type `B`, the universal property of
the quotient construction induces for every function `A → B` a function `Quotient.lift` such that
`Quotient.lift f ⟦a⟧ = f a` for all `a : A`.

In diagramatic terms this means that the following diagram commutes:
… draw a tikz diagram here:
A pointing to B via the arrow labeled f
A pointing to Quotient A via the arrow labeled Quotient.mk
There's a dashed arrow labeled Quotient.lift f going from Quotient A to B.
