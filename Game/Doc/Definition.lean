/-- `Function.RightInverse f g` is defined as `LeftInverse g f`.
In other words: `∀ x, g (f x) = x`.

You have to write `Function.RightInverse`  instead of `RightInverse`,
as `RightInverse` is ambigous in Leanic.
-/
DefinitionDoc Function.RightInverse as "RightInverse" in "Function"
-- Note the fact that one sees `LeftInverse` but `Function.RightInverse` is because
-- some mathlib init-file defines `_root_.RightInverse`. mathlib4#11415 investigates this.

`LeftInverse g f` means `g ∘ f = id`, or more exactly:
`∀ x, g (f x) = x`, as can be seen with `unfold`.

For `A B : Set T`, `A ⊆ B` means that `A` is contained in `B`.

With `rw [subset_iff]`, you can rewrite `A ⊆ B` as `∀ x, x ∈ A → x ∈ B`.

If `A ⊆ B` is the proof goal, you can also directly use `intro a ha`
to select an element `a` with `ha : a ∈ A` (and then show `a ∈ B`).

If `h : A ⊆ B` is an assumption and an element `a` with `ha : a ∈ A` is given,
you can use `have hb := h ha` to obtain the statement `hb : a ∈ B`.

You write `⊆` as `\subset`.

`∅ : Set T` is the empty subset.
In the Formaloverse `∅ : Set ℕ` is something different than `∅ : Set ℝ`
– one is a subset of ℕ, the other is a subset of ℝ!

With `rw [eq_empty_iff_forall_notMem]` you translate the equation `S = ∅` into the
statement `∀ (x : T), x ∉ s`.

`∅` is written as `\emptyset`.

`Nonempty`
for `T`, `T : Type`, `Nonempty T` means T is non-empty

As goal:
given `t`, `t : T`, use `use t`
given `a`, `a : T` such that `a ∈ A`, `ha : a ∈ A`, use `use a`
As assumption:
given `h : Nonempty T`, use `obtain ⟨t⟩ := t` to obtain `t`, `t : T`

/--
`(A : Prop)` is any statement, without further specification as to whether it is true, false, or
unprovable.

See also `(True : Prop)` and `(False : Prop)` for the unconditionally true and false
statements, respectively.

/--
`A ∧ B` (“and”) is the statement that both `A` and `B` are true.

## `A ∧ B` as a proof goal

The tactic `constructor` allows you to prove the two sub-statements `A` and `B` individually.

## `A ∧ B` as an assumption

With `obtain ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ := h`, you break down an assumption of the form `h : A ∧ B`
into its components `h₁ : A` and `h₂ : B`.
-/
DefinitionDoc And as "∧" in "Logic"

/--
`A ∨ B` (“or”) is the statement that at least one of the statements `A`, `B` is true.

## `A ∨ B` as proof goal

You can use the tactics `left` or `right` to decide
which statement you want to prove.

## `A ∨ B` as an assumption

Since you do not know which of the statements `A` or `B` you can assume,
you may have to show the proof goal twice:
once under the assumption `A` and once under the assumption `B`.
To do this, use the tactic
```
obtain h | h := h
```
-/
DefinitionDoc Or as "∨" in "Logic"

/--
For `A B : Prop`, `A → B` is the implication “`A` implies `B`.”
For other `X Y : Type`, `X → Y` is a mapping that maps values from `X` to `Y`.

## Implication as proof goal

If your proof goal is an implication `A → B`, with `intro h` you can assume `h : A`,
and then you must prove `B`.

## Implication as assumption

To use an implication among your assumptions, use the tactic `apply`.
-/
DefinitionDoc Arrow as "→" in "Logic"

/--
`A ↔ B` means that statements `A` and `B` are logically equivalent (“if and only if”).

## `↔` as proof target

To show `A ↔ B`, you can, for example, call `constructor`
and then prove `A → B` and `B → A` separately.

## `↔` as an assumption

You can break down an assumption of the form `h : A ↔ B` using `obtain ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ := h` into its two components
`h₁ : A → B` and `h₂ : B → A`.
However, you can also refer directly to these components with `h.mp` and `h.mpr`.
(The abbreviation `mp` stands for “modus ponens”.)

DefinitionDoc Iff as "↔" in "Logic"

/--
Existential quantifier: If `P : A → Prop` is a predicate, then
`∃ a : A, P a` is the statement that an element `a` in `A` (more precisely: of type `A`)
exists for which the statement `P a` is true.
A pure existence statement ("there is an element of type `A`)
can be formulated, for example, as `∃ a : A, true` or as `Nonempty A`.

## `∃` as a proof goal

To prove a statement of the form `∃ a : A, …`,
you construct a suitable element `a` and then use the `use` tactic (`use a`).

## `∃` as an assumption

You can decompose an assumption of the form `h : ∃ a : A, P a` into its components using
`choose a ha using h` or `obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := h` into `a : A` and `ha : P a`.
-/
DefinitionDoc Exists as "∃" in "Logic"

/--
Existential quantifier: If `P : A → Prop` is a predicate, then
`∃! a : A, P a` is the statement that *exactly one* element `a` in `A` (more precisely: of type `A`)
exists for which the statement `P a` is true.
The statement therefore has two parts: first, such an `a` exists, and second, `a` is unique.
## `∃!` as a proof goal

To prove a statement of the form `∃! a : A, …`, first construct a suitable element `a` and
then use the `use` tactic (`use a`), usually immediately followed by `simp`.
The proof goal should then have the following form:

`P a ∧ ∀ a' : A, P a' → a' = a`

On the left is `P a`: you still have to show that `a` has the required property.
On the right is the uniqueness statement: every element with this property is equal to `a`.

## `∃!` as an assumption

You can prove an assumption of the form `h : ∃! a : A, P a` with

```
  obtain ⟨a, h_exists, h_unique⟩ := h
  simp at h_unique
```
into its components
```
   a : A
   h_exists : P a
   h_unique : ∀ (y : A), P y → y = a
```
.
-/
DefinitionDoc ExistsUnique as "∃!" in "Logic"


/--
Universal quantifier: If `P : A → Prop` is a predicate, then
`∀ a : A, P a` is the statement that the statement `P a` is true for all `a` in `A`
(more precisely: for all `a` of type `A`).
## `∀` as a proof goal
To prove a statement of the form `∀ a : A, …`, first use `intro a` to select any element `a`.
## `∀` as an assumption
If `h : ∀ a : A, P a` is an assumption and `a₀ : A` is a concrete element, then `h a₀` is a notation for `P a₀`.

You can also use `specialize h a₀` to restrict the given assumption
over all possible `a` to an assumption `h : P a₀` over this concrete `a₀`.-/
DefinitionDoc Forall as "∀" in "Logic"


/--
The statement `True : Prop` is always true.

## `True` as a proof target

The tactics `tauto` and `decide` conclude every proof with `True` as the proof target.

## `True` as an assumption

As an assumption, `True` is not helpful at all.
-/
DefinitionDoc True as "True" in "Logic"

/--
The statement `False : Prop` is always false.

## `False` as proof target

If `False` is your proof target, you can try to find a contradiction in your assumptions, for example.
Once the contradiction is sufficiently evident, `contradiction` concludes such a proof.

If `False` is your proof goal and you have an assumption or lemma of the form `h : ¬ A` available,
you can use `apply h` to change the proof goal to `A`
(because `¬ A` means `A → False`).

## `False`  as an assumption

If you have `False` as an assumption, you can immediately end the proof with `contradiction`
– because, as is well known, any other statement follows from a false statement.
-/
DefinitionDoc False as "False" in "Logic"

/--
`¬ A` is the logical negation of `A`.
It is implemented internally as `A → False`.  You can see this with `unfold Not`.

Useful tactics are: `push Not`, `by_contra`, `contrapose`.
You can also apply an assumption of the form `h : ¬ A` using `apply` to the proof target `False`.

## Friends and relatives
