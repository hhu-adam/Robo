## Translation

The game is not yet ready for translation.
We will use (an updated version of) [`lean-i18n`](https://github.com/hhu-adam/lean-i18n).
Before translation, the lean project `Robo` needs to be built once to make sure the file `.i18n/de/Game.pot` is up-to-date.
Any software to create a file `./i18n/en/Game.po` containing the translations (where you replace `en` with the ISO language code for your language) can be used.
The recommended software for editing PO-files is [Poedit](https://poedit.net/)
