## Translation

The game is not yet ready for translation.
We will use (an updated version of) [`lean-i18n`](https://github.com/hhu-adam/lean-i18n).
Before translation, the lean project `Robo` needs to be built once to make sure the file `.i18n/de/Game.pot` is up-to-date.
Any software to create a file `./i18n/en/Game.po` containing the translations (where you replace `en` with the ISO language code for your language) can be used.
The recommended software for editing PO-files is [Poedit](https://poedit.net/)

## Translating Robo from minimal english to desired language

Robo now has its introductions, conclusions and hints written in a minimal english version, which
should help translators in creating translations of Robo for their desired language. The `.pot` file
can be found in `.i18n/min_template/min_game.pot`.
A first translation from "minimal english" into german can be found in `.i18n/de/Game.po`.

### Structure of minimal template
Each entry of `.i18n/min_template/min_game.pot` contains all lean snippets needed and discussed in for the level or proof step it concerns. Those lean snippets are saved as comments of the form `#. §n: `...` `, where `§n` is the `n`-th lean snippet as it should appear in the translation.

### Tipps for using translation scripts
In case a translation is partially or fully done by e.g. scripts, the following section will share the means of identifying single entries in the `.pot` file:

Firstly, each entry can be identified by its level name which can be find as custom non-po standard comment of form `#: `.
Furthermore, some comments contain either `INTRO` or `CONC`, which together with the level name, can be used to identify introduction/conclusion entries by e.g. python scripts.
