# Images

## Sources

The images here are reduced verions of the ones at [Robo-Images](https://github.com/hhu-adam/Robo-Images). You should add the high quality originals there in the folder `fullsize/` and then run the script `./fetch_images.sh` to download smaller versions into the game.

## Quality

You can modify `NEWSIZE` in this script to the desired quality. Look up [imagemagick docs](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) for details about the `convert` command.
